I am a **PhD Candidate in Epidemiology** at **The Ohio State University** (Expected May 2026). My research focuses on **oncology real-world evidence (RWE)**, retrospective observational study design, and advanced statistical programming in **R and SQL**.

Currently, my dissertation examines the structural and spatial factors associated with HIV viral load suppression and drug resistance in East Africa, utilizing population-based survey data.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I gained significant industry and federal experience:
* **Analysis Group (HEOR Associate Intern):** I led retrospective oncology RWE analyses, developing pipelines in R and SQL for multiple myeloma studies.
* **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Epidemiologist):** I supported national HIV surveys (PHIA) in five African countries and analyzed complex survey data for the Division of Global HIV & TB.
* **CDC COVID-19 Task Force:** I managed clinician-reported reinfection investigations and built REDCap reporting systems.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between complex data and actionable health insights. My technical toolkit includes advanced **R (tidyverse, survey)**, **SQL (Snowflake)**, **Python**, and **ArcGIS Pro**.

**Interests:** Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR), Real-World Evidence, Oncology, Infectious Disease, and Causal Inference.
